# Reduced type configuration for WebAssembly builds.
# This limits globally allowed types for all operators to reduce binary size (~230KB).
# See https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/reference/operators/reduced-operator-config-file.html
#
# Usage: pass to build.py via:
#   --include_ops_by_config onnxruntime/wasm/reduced_types.config --enable_reduced_operator_type_support
#
# Excluded types: float4, float8, float64 (double), int16, uint16

# Keep all operators - only apply type reduction
!no_ops_specified_means_all_ops_are_required

# Globally allowed types for all operators
!globally_allowed_types;bool,int8_t,uint8_t,int32_t,uint32_t,int64_t,uint64_t,float,MLFloat16
